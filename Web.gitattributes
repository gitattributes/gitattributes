# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text

# NOTE - originally I had the above line un-commented.  it caused me a lot of grief related to line endings because I was dealing with WordPress plugins and the website changing line endings out if a user modified a plugin through the web interface.  commenting this line out seems to have alleviated the git chaos where simply switching to a branch caused it to believe 500 files were modified.

# The above will handle all files NOT found below
